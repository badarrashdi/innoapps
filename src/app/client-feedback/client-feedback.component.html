                      <p>Best of the best. It was an excellent experience dealing with Ankit, from quality of work to communication to meeting the target dates it was fantastic. The design work was better than what I wished for, he is very competent and knowledgeable which made it a lot easier for me to deal with him. Thanks for the great work. I am already engaged with him on two other contracts.</p>
